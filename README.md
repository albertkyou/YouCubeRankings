Rankings for YouTube cubers

Things that need to be done:

For MVP
1. User form to enter User IDs
2. Read User IDs from txt/csv file
3. Store User IDs, ytimg, and score in CSV file
3. Create front-end to update page


Nice to haves:
1. Automate the form to pull User IDs (look at Weebly API)
2. Maybe allow users to submit Channel IDs (but will require more tokens)
3. Set up JS so users can use free tokens to grab their User IDs using their Channel ID
4. Push changes in scores to website automatically (or after pushing to git)
